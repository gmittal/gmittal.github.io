<p class="p6"><b><i>Day 1</i> - <i>The Flight to Dubai</i></b></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8">Wednesday, December 14, 2011</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The first day of our vacation was mostly on a plane or in a car. I was picked up from school at around noon.</p>
<p class="p8">We quickly got in our car and drove home where we would meet the cab that drove us to the airport. When we got<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">home I was surprised to find that the cab was actually a bus! I thought is was a bit big for four people but my brother,</p>
<p class="p8">Adi, thought it was very cool. Once we got to the airport we quickly checked our baggage in and went through security,<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">from where we went to a lounge. After waiting for an hour or so we went to the gate, where we promptly boarded the plane.</p>
<p class="p8">The plane was nice and it was our first time on Emirates, an Arab airline. For the first few hours of the flight I read the books</p>
<p class="p8">I had packed. I watched some movies and fell a sleep. After another few hours we landed in Dubai, UAE ( <i>United Arab Emi-</i></p>
<p class="p8"><i>rates </i>). I was quite excited to see Dubai as for I had never been there before. By the time we had reached<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬† </span>Dubai it was<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">Thursday night ( or Thursday Morning in California ). Another cab came and we went to our hotel. Once we got</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span>to the hotel we explored the pool areas and the beach. After a few hours of browsing pools we went to sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><i>Day 2 - Tour of Dubai</i></b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p8">Friday, December 16, 2011</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>We quickly woke up ( at 3am due to our jet lag ), and went to go find out if we could get a tour of Dubai. We found out</p>
<p class="p8">that we could catch a double-decker bus straight from our hotel. So we explored the resort's various shops ( which mostly</p>
<p class="p8">were not open ). We quickly had a breakfast from Starbucks and boarded the bus. The bus tour took us to many places in Dubai.</p>
<p class="p8">Our first stop was at <i>The Mall of the Emirates.</i> Where we saw Dubai's indoor skiing resort. We had lunch at the mall and got</p>
<p class="p8">back on the bus. Our next stop was to the Dubai mall. It was not as big as The Mall of the Emirates but still was nice. We saw</p>
<p class="p8">the world's tallest building, The Burj Al Kalifah, which looked like the <i>Space Needle</i> except it did not have a restaurant at the top.</p>
<p class="p8">It was huge at the bottom and then got thinner and thinner as it got higher. We then took the bus to the Dubai Museum, which</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span>we did not see. We had stopped at the museum to change buses. We caught another bus and went to the Gold Souk ( Gold Market ).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span>We saw a lot of gold and jewelry shops. There were also other gift shops that sold caps and t-shirts that said</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span>Gold Souk or Dubai. We were more interested in the gift shops. While we were walking in the Gold Souk, we saw a shop that<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">had the world's largest ring. The ring was a Guinness World Record holder. After driving by some</p>
<p class="p8">other sights, we came to our hotel. We went to our room and quickly changed into our swimsuits. We went to the pool</p>
<p class="p8">that we had seen the previous day and swam for an hour.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><i>Day 3 - Flight to Bombay</i></b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p8">Saturday, December 17, 2011</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>After having a better nights sleep, we ate breakfast and took our baggage downstairs. We checked-out and went outside</p>
<p class="p8">to meet our Emirates car. The driver took us to the airport, where we checked our baggage in. We went through security</p>
<p class="p8">and to the gate. We boarded the plane and took off. I watched a movie and read ( basically the same thing I did in the other<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">plane ). The plane ride was 2.5 hours ( which is really short compared to the other 15 hour flight ). When we landed it<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">was 5:30pm ( Bombay Time Zone, 13.5 hours ahead of California ). By the time the Emirates car came it was 6:30pm.</p>
<p class="p8">The one problem was that the Emirates car was too small, and couldn't fit all of our luggage. So we waited as he called another</p>
<p class="p8">car to come. We went to my Dadaji and Dadiji's house ( grandfather and grandmother ). When we got there, I flopped on the</p>
<p class="p8">bed and fell asleep.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><i>Day 4 - A Day in Andheri</i></b><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8">Sunday, December 18, 2011</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Our jet lag was still off so we ended up waking at 4am ( which is not that pleasant ). We ate some breakfast, and we went downstairs</p>
<p class="p8">to get our cellphone SIM cards fixed. Luckily an <i>Airtel</i> ( Indian AT&amp;T ) shop happened to be right next to our building. Our previous</p>
<p class="p8">phone company had been Reliance, which was still good but we couldn't find a Reliance shop. We walked into the Airtel shop and he</p>
<p class="p8">offered us a great plan that was cheaper than USD 10.00. We came back to the flat and my Fufaji and Buaji ( Uncle and Aunt ) came to<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">visit. After that we all went to a restaurant called <i>The Courtyard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></i></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><i>Day 5 - Another Day in Andheri</i></b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p8">Monday, December 19, 2011</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>We did our usual morning routine<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬† </span>( the same one I have been repeating over and over again ), and went and caught a cab to the<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8"><i>Gateway of India</i>. When we got there we went around and took some pictures. Then we walked across the street to a hotel</p>
<p class="p8">called the Taj. We went to a bookstore and bought some books, I was surprised that the bookstore had the biography</p>
<p class="p8">of <i>Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson</i>. I bought an Asterix book which I finished before I even got out of the Taj. We had<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">lunch at a restaurant called the <i>Shamiana.</i> After that we went back home. We did our usual evening routine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬† ¬†</span></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><i>Day 6 - Last Day in Andheri</i></b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p8">Tuesday, December 20, 2011</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>We did our usual morning routine and we went for a haircut. We had been thinking about getting an indian style haircut for a<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">while ( actually I think we had been planning a little too deeply into getting that haircut ),and today we finally got it. It was</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span>very different from the way a haircut in the US is done. First, they don't use electrical clippers ( nothing</p>
<p class="p8">is electrical in the haircut ), they use razor blades similar to the ones you shave with. Second, they don't ask you what size, or how short</p>
<p class="p8">you want your hair, they just seat you and give you a haircut. Third, it is very affordable. My haircut had cost less than a dollar. We then went to see the</p>
<p class="p8">movie <i>The Adventures of TinTin: The Secret of the Unicorn</i>, It was a good movie and we saw it 48 hours before it came out in the US.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span>I read for a while and sat in the flat. After a few hours our friends who live on the 7th floor of our building came to play with us.</p>
<p class="p8">We spent two hours at their place and then came down to the Ground floor to play badminton. The only problem was that it was</p>
<p class="p8">quite late at night and mosquitos wouldn't stop biting me. We came back to our flat and then went to sleep.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>

<p class="p8">Wednesday, December 21, 2011</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>We did our usual morning routine quickly and caught a cab. We were going to IIT ( <i>Indian Institute of Technology </i>) to drop</p>
<p class="p8">off my dad so he could go to his IIT reunion. After going to IIT we went to Thane, where my Dadu and Dida ( grandfather and<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">grandmother ) live. When we got to there house I spent the entire afternoon reading and playing on our iPad. We did<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">our usual evening routine.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><i>Day 8 - Sitting at Home in Thane</i></b></p>

<p class="p8">Thursday, December 22, 2011</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>This paragraph is not worth writing. If you read the second-to-last sentence of the previous paragraph,</p>
<p class="p8">you will get an idea of what I did all day‚Ä¶ which is not worth writing about.</p>

<p class="p6"><b><i>Day 9 - Another Day in Thane</i></b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p8">Friday, December 23, 2011</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>We woke up and finished breakfast quickly. We tried to <i>Skype</i> with my little cousin, Kunal, but it didn't work. We then went to go see</p>
<p class="p8">the movie <i>Alvin and the Chipmunks 3: Chipwrecked </i>which was a <b>horrible</b> movie. The only person who thought it was actually</p>
<p class="p8">good was Adi ( who was also the one who kept on begging to go see the movie ). We came back, ate lunch and then sat in the flat (<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">I was doing my normal thing when we sit in a flat, reading ). We went to the market and I bought a really nice pen for what<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">would have been USD 0.20. For dinner we had <i>Dominos Pizza </i>which was very good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><i>Day 10 - Yet Another Day in Thane</i></b></p>

<p class="p8">Saturday, December 24, 2011</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>We woke up and <i>Skyped</i> with Kunal. It was nice seeing him since we were in India. We drove to IIT</p>
<p class="p8">for the Class of<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬† </span>'86 reunion. We saw many people and we sat through a couple of lectures. It was</p>
<p class="p8">over all very nice to see the campus. The campus is <i>nothing</i> like Stanford University, the college we're</p>
<p class="p8">used to seeing all the time. First, the campus is beside a lake, which is crocodile infested. Second, its got</p>
<p class="p8">a lot of animals, including oxen, cattle, stray dogs, the occasional goat, and at 6am or so<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬† </span>there is<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">said to be a panther lurking around. We had lunch and then we went for a department tour. I didn't go on the</p>
<p class="p8">department tour because I was feeling tired, instead I sat in the IIT Guest House where my dad was staying</p>
<p class="p8">and watched some TV. After that we went to go find the Alumni Gift Shop, anxious to by some IIT wear. The shopkeeper</p>
<p class="p8">had closed the shop early ( I am not calling him stupid, but he should have left that shop open extra <i>late </i>because so many</p>
<p class="p8">alumni were on campus ). We then caught a cab and went home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>I woke up and sent some Christmas E-cards. We went to a mall called HyperCity. It was a lot like the Targets we see in US just that it had</p>
<p class="p8">various other stores within it. We went to a <i>Crosswords</i> Bookshop where I got a video game and a book ( as my Christmas present ). We then</p>
<p class="p8">explored the shops' various items including juices, chocolates, snacks, etc. After looking around HyperCity, we went to MegaStore which happens</p>
<p class="p8">to be right next to HyperCity. It had a lot of clothing so it wasn't really that fun to see. We went back home in an Auto Rickshaw... which I nearly</p>
<p class="p8">fell out of. We did the usual evening routine.</p>

<p class="p8">Monday, December 26, 2011</p>

<p class="p8">I spent the entire day at home again. Which is not worth writing about. So here is another paragraph skipped.</p>

<p class="p8">Tuesday, December 27, 2011</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>We woke up and spent the morning getting ready and reading. We had a short lunch and then we went to the market again.</p>
<p class="p8">I bought a notepad from the same shop I had bought my pen from, again this notepad was very cheap. After that we went to<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">another friends' house. We sat as we watched a six-year-old dance <i>Kathak </i>very well. After that we went home and had <i>Dominoes Pizza</i></p>
<p class="p8">again. We came back and I fell asleep.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p8">Wednesday, December 28, 2011</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>We woke up and tried to book a cab back to Andheri ( the place where my Dadaji and Dadiji stay ). We found that both our cell phones<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p class="p8">didn't work. We found out that it was an Airtel mistake. There apparently had been some fire at the data center so we could not get any</p>
<p class="p8">service. We still managed to get the cab booked because we still had internet. After we had solved that problem the cab came. We drove</p>
<p class="p8">to Andheri and we went to another one of my Dadu's house. I sat and read the book I had bought from HyperCity ( <i>The Red Pyramid</i> if anyone</p>
<p class="p8">was wondering ) and played some iPad. I continued to do the same things until 3pm, from where we left to go to a place called <i>Infiniti Mall</i>.</p>
<p class="p8">We bought a few things that were products of my Dadu's company. We then left the mall. We came back and we had dinner with all my family in</p>
<p class="p8">both Andheri and Thane. The only person who was not with us was my Dadu in Thane. After that we went back to my Dadaji and Dadiji's house.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>

<p class="p6"><b><i>Day 15 - Andheri</i></b></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8">Thursday, December 29, 2011</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8">We got up and got ready quickly. We then spent the morning at home ( you probably know what I did ). After lunch we went to play with our</p>
<p class="p8">friends on the 7th floor of our building. After playing with them for a few hours, the rest of my family came for dinner. We had some of my</p>
<p class="p8">favorite foods including: paneer ( indian tofu ), soup, subzi ( steamed and/or cooked vegetables ), roti ( similar to tortilla ), garlic bread.</p>
<p class="p8">So this dinner was more of an Indian-Italian fusion. After that we played on our iPad, and messed with some Lego. After another few hours</p>
<p class="p8">we came back to our flat on the 3rd floor.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b><i>Day 16 - Bombay Temples</i></b></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8">Friday, December 30, 2011</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8">We did our usual morning routine and got in our car. We drove to a temple named Gaudaya Math, and it was quite interesting, it had inscriptions of legends and such</p>
<p class="p8">in Hindi, Bengali, and English. I understood all of them ( luckily ). After that we drove to an even <i>bigger</i> temple. It was very very crowded, there had</p>
<p class="p8">to be at least 2000 people there, maybe more. We went inside the temple and I was surprised how many people were crammed in there. It was very easy</p>
<p class="p8">getting in there. Getting out was much harder. We had squeeze through a lot of people standing in the way. Luckily, there were security guards helping</p>
<p class="p8">to control the crowd. When we got out we tried to call our driver. The only problem was Airtel wasn't working. Airtel had failed us at exact wrong moment.</p>
<p class="p8">We eventually were able to send an SMS to our driver. After that we went to a really nice restaurant called <i>Copper Chimney</i>, It had a lot of very good</p>
<p class="p8">food. I think my favorite part was the desert. After that we came home and rested for an hour. We then went to a clothing shop to buy some new t-shirts</p>
<p class="p8">and such. After that we went to the 7th floor play with our friends again. After that we came back to have dinner. We then tried staying up all night ( which</p>
<p class="p8">didn't work too well, we fell asleep at 11:30pm ).<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
